Some levels have special objectives to be completed, which may be optional or required to win.\nIf a human is killed then they'll come back as a zombie, which makes it even more difficult for the remaining humans.</p>\n\n<p>The goal for the zombies is to kill all of the humans, making them all zombies and causing everyone to lose the round.\nAlternatively, a zombie can kill four humans to be redeemed. This allows them a second chance at survival and victory.\nRemember, the only way to win a round is to be a human when the round ends. Zombies can't technically win the game; zombies can only make everyone else lose!</p>\n\n<p>A certain amount of people are chosen (or volunteer) for being the starting zombies.

It may seem like the undead aren't a threat early on but eventually they'll be powerful enough to kill your entire team in a few seconds.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing keeping the zombies out is a well-built and well-maintained barricade.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of tools that give you the ability to set this up. The one most useful tool is the hammer and nails. This allows you to nail down props which then must have the nails destroyed in order for the zombies to get to you.\nPosition the prop you want to nail by pressing USE on it to pick it up. You can hold SPRINT while holding it to lock it in place. Then take your hammer and right click where you want the nail to go. It's a good idea to nail the prop to a sturdy object such as a wall instead of other props.\nRemember, when a prop is nailed it will forward the damage it takes to the nails themselves. You can repair nails by hitting them with the hammer but eventually they'll become too damaged to repair anymore. You can hold SHIFT with the hammer out to get a view of every single nail deployed on your screen as well as the owner.\nIf you think a nail is in a bad place or you'd like to reposition a prop, you can remove nails by pointing at it and pressing RELOAD. Be warned, if you take a nail that doesn't belong to you then you will be given a point penalty.\nOne more thing to remember: nails take less damage when they're nailed to bigger props. The bigger the size of the prop, the less damage its nails take and the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>One other tool is the 'Aegis' Barricade Kit. This quick-deploying tool allows you to place boards on any surface or deploy them between two walls. It doesn't even need props. To use it, you need to position a board in a spot that is legal. The ghost will turn from red to green to let you know.\nDeploy a board by pressing PRIMARY ATTACK. Rotate the board by using SECONDARY ATTACK and RELOAD. It uses boards for ammunition so boards you have from the Board Pack work as extra ammunition! You can pack up boards you've deployed by pressing SPRINT while pointing at it.</p>\n\n<p>Another tool worth noting is the Turret. This tosses bullets at any zombie that gets in the way of its laser. Its only downside is that it requires ammunition. You can refill ammunition by pressing USE on it. This will give you bonus points for helping the team.\nTo deploy the turret, position it in a way so that the ghost is green. It must be on a solid surface (no props!). Rotate the turret with SECONDARY ATTACK and RELOAD. If you mess up, you can always pack the turret back up by pressing SPRINT while pointing at it. Remember, the turret will only fire at zombies that cross its tracking beam.</p>\n\n<p>Tips for this section:\n<ul>\n<li>You get a 25% point bonus for killing zombies that are attacking a barricade!</li>\n<li>Use bigger props for barricades. The nails take less damage and the prop has room for more nails. In addition to that, it even acts as cover from projectiles.</li>\n</ul></p>" LANGUAGE.help_cont_upgrades = "<p>Points are obtained through killing zombies, healing team mates, and building defenses.\nYou can then exchange points in the Points Shop at Arsenal Crates.</p>\n\n<p>Tips for this section:\n<ul>\n<li>Try planning ahead.
